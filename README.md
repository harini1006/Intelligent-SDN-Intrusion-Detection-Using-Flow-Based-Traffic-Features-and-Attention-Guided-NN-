# Intelligent SDN Intrusion Detection System
## Machine Learning–Based Flow Traffic Classification for Secure SDN Networks 
## 📌Overview:
The Intelligent SDN Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a flow-based traffic classification system designed to enhance the security of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments.
It uses Machine Learning models, built using Scikit-learn and deployed through Flask, to classify network flows as Normal or Malicious.

The system supports:

1.Real-time single flow prediction

2.CSV-based bulk log prediction

3.User authentication

4.Admin analytics dashboard with attack distribution charts

The goal is to strengthen SDN security by providing a fast, scalable, and intelligent intrusion detection solution.

## ❗Problem Statement:
SDN environments rely on a centralized controller, making them vulnerable to several attacks such as DDoS, Probing, Spoofing, and Botnet traffic.
Traditional IDS systems face challenges including:

1.High false positives

2.Lack of adaptability to new attacks

3.Heavy dependency on signatures

4.Manual and slow log analysis

5.Inability to scale with high-volume SDN traffic

A Machine Learning–driven IDS is necessary to handle SDN flow datasets efficiently and detect malicious traffic with high accuracy.

## 🎯Objectives:
• Develop a robust ML model to classify SDN flow traffic

• Provide real-time and batch prediction capabilities

• Create a user-friendly web interface for easy usage

• Enable admin monitoring through graphical analytics

• Improve accuracy and reduce false alarms

• Design a scalable system suitable for modern SDN networks.
